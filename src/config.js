<p class="p1">Dear <b>${username}</b>,</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">we wanted to let you know that everything has worked smoothly and we already started growing your account. If we need anything from you or have further questions during our collaboration, we will let you know!</p>
<p class="p1"><br>
There are a few more things you can do in your dashboard on our website besides tracking your growth, and we would like to give you more <b>detailed information.<br>
<br>
</b>Note that the information below is not mandatory for you to know, but we want to give you these options in case you want to have more control yourself<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚úÖ </span><b>AI Filters:</b></p>
<p class="p1">As you know our AI analyzes the followers of your target accounts before we make them aware of your account. This way you will - in average - receive higher quality followers than your target accounts.</p>
<p class="p1">At the end of this e-mail you will find a list of the default AI filters that we currently use.<br>
In your dashboard you have the option to adjust your filters. <br>
But keep in mind ‚Äì being too strict can lead to less follower growth.<br>
Our recommendation is to keep filters unchanged, but we want to give you the option to change them if needed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚úÖ </span><b>Whitelist:</b></p>
<p class="p1">The whitelist in your dashboard can be used to let our team know you would like to follow someone they have followed permanently.</p>
<p class="p1">By default all users that our team likes and follows are added to a list and everyone on that list will be unfollowed. Please note we only unfollow accounts that we have ‚Äúfollowed first‚Äù.<br>
Accounts that we have never followed, you do not need to add to the whitelist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚úÖ </span><b>Blacklist:</b></p>
<p class="p1">The blacklist in your dashboard can be used to let our team know if there is someone you do not want us to like or follow. This can be used if you have any close competitors that we should not like.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Default AI filters used for good growth and quality:<br>
</p>
<p class="p1">- Accounts need to have more than 6 posts.</p>
<p class="p1">- Accounts need to have less than 3000 followings (= other people they follow).</p>
<p class="p1">- Accounts need to have more than 50 followers.</p>
<p class="p1">- Accounts may never be followed twice.</p>
<p class="p1">- Accounts that follow or like you may be liked more often.</p>
<p class="p1">- Accounts that do not follow you may only be liked on one day.</p>
<p class="p1">- Accounts may not have any forbidden words in their name or bio. Contact us to add new words.</p>
<p class="p1">- Accounts are prioritized if they use a common first name in their name.</p>
