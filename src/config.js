  <p>We wanted to let you know that all the configurations in your dashboard have been applied!</p>
  <p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us at any time!</p>
  <p>For pro users, we have included some additional information below! üòä</p>

  <h3>‚úÖ Welcome Messages for New Followers</h3>
  <p>This feature used to be only available for an additional charge. Now, we can send a welcome message to all your new followers without any additional charges. This feature is particularly popular among businesses looking to promote their products, or individuals eager to initiate conversations with new followers. Just reply to this email with the message text you'd like us to use!</p>

  <h3>‚úÖ Whitelist:</h3>
  <p>Use the whitelist feature in your dashboard to inform our team if you want to keep someone we have followed permanently. We will not unfollow any users added to your whitelist. Note that you do not need to add accounts that you are already following or that you have followed before we did.</p>

  <h3>‚úÖ Blacklist:</h3>
  <p>The blacklist feature allows you to let us know if there are any accounts you prefer we do not interact with, whether by liking, story liking, or following. This is particularly useful for avoiding interaction with close competitors.</p>

  <h3>‚úÖ Our newest AI Filters</h3>
  <p>Our AI technology analyzes the followers of your target accounts to ensure your account attracts only their high-quality followers. Below is a list of the default AI filters we apply. You have the option to set custom filters in your dashboard, but we advise maintaining the default settings for optimal follower growth.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accounts must have more than 6 posts.</li>
    <li>Accounts must have fewer than 4000 followings.</li>
    <li>Accounts must have more than 50 followers.</li>
    <li>An account may never be followed twice.</li>
    <li>Accounts that do not follow you maybe only be liked once with maximal four likes.</li>
    <li>Accounts must not have any blacklisted words in their name or bio.</li>
    <li>Accounts with common first names in their full name or username are prioritized.</li>
  </ul>
